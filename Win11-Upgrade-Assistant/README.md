### Step 2: Generate a SAS Token
1. In the container, select the ISO
2. Click **"Generate SAS"**
3. Set **permissions** to `Read (r)`
4. Set a long **expiry date** (e.g., 1 year)
5. Copy:
   - **Blob URL** (e.g., `https://yourstorage.blob.core.windows.net/win11/Win11.iso`)
   - **SAS Token** (starts with `?sv=...`)

---

## üìù Configure the Script
Open `Launch-Win11-AzCopy.ps1` and update:

```powershell
$blobUrl = "<Your Blob URL>"      # e.g., https://yourstorage.blob.core.windows.net/win11/Win11.iso
$sasToken = "<Your SAS Token>"    # starts with ? and includes &sig=...
```

Do NOT share your real SAS token publicly.
